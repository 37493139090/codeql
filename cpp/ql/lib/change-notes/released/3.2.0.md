## 3.2.0

### New Features

* A new abstract class `ConfigurationTestFile` (`semmle.code.cpp.ConfigurationTestFile.ConfigurationTestFile`) was introduced, which represents files created to test the build configuration. A subclass `CmakeTryCompileFile` of `ConfigurationTestFile` was also introduced, which represents files created by CMake to test the build configuration.
* New predicates `getARequiresClause`, `getTemplateRequiresClause` and `getFunctionRequiresClause` were added to the `FunctionDeclarationEntry` class, which yield the requires clauses when the entry represents a function template declaration with requires clauses.
* A new predicate `getRequiresClause` was added to the `TypeDeclarationEntry` class, which yields the requires clause when the entry represents a class template declaration with a requires clause.
* A new predicate `getRequiresClause` was added to the `VariableDeclarationEntry` class, which yields the requires clause when the entry represents a variable template declaration with a requires clause.
* A new predicate `getTypeConstraint` was added to the `TypeTemplateParameter` class, which yields the type constraint of the parameter if it exists.
* A new class `VariableTemplateSpecialization` was introduced, which represents explicit specializations of variable templates.
* A new predicate `isSpecialization` was added to the `Variable` class, which holds if the variable is a template specialization.
* A new class `ConceptIdExpr` was introduced, which represents C++20 concept id expressions.
* A new class `Concept` was introduced, which represents C++20 concepts.
* The `getTemplateArgumentType` and `getTemplateArgumentValue` predicates of the `Declaration` class now also yield template arguments of concepts.
